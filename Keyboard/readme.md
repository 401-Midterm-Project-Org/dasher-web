Keyboard Proof of Concept
=========================
This directory is for custom keyboard proofs of concept.

The custom keyboards make use of the Captive Web View library. Captive Web View
is an Open Source project from VMware. This repository integrates the Captive
Web View repository as a Git submodule.

For instructions and code, see the sub-directories:

-   [forAndroid](forAndroid) for the Android Input Method Service custom
    keyboard.
-   [foriOS](foriOS) for the iOS Keyboard App Extension.

Notes
=====
These notes apply to all platforms.

-   ToDo: Add an option for automatically appending a space on stop.

-   ToDo: Add some way for the user to increase and decrease the amount of
    screen space occupied by the keyboard.

Backlog
=======
-   Optimise childWeights to have a setter and calculate totalWeight there.
    Remove the .map calls.
-   Maybe optimise origin_holder to have callbacks before and after descent.
-   Change terminology of "origin holder" to maybe "delta target".
-   Trim and untrim left end of message.
-   Show message in the UI somewhere copy-pastable.
-   Capital letters, punctuation, spaces, paragraph markers.
-   Group boxes.
